This folder contains scripts for converting data into a 
Moses corpus and for building a Moses model from the corpus.

Requirements:

- Translate toolkit (see http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/toolkit/index)
- Installation of Moses (see http://www.statmt.org/moses_steps.html)
- Bilingual data in any bilingual format supported by the Translate toolkit 
   (see http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/toolkit/formats)

---- do_everything.sh ----

do_everything.sh calls other scripts in order to perform the
following stages:

1. Download data from server or copy from file system
2. Segment PO data
3. Write pocounts for data
4. Convert data to Moses format
5. Build a (simple) Moses model

All variables must be set in variables.sh. Stages of the process
can be bypassed by setting the switches in variables.sh.

---- build_model.sh ----

At the moment, a simple model is built using only bilingual data.
Tuning the weights of the model is optional and can be set in 
variables.sh.

Options for adding dictionaries and monolignual target data etc. must
be added.
